# 📝 Notes

- It got cold overnight  - deluged and drenched when the rain came in.  Everyone is miserable and cold.   We'll be stopping at the next town, and there are several rooms reserved at the inn.
- Caravan Workers aren't allowed to sleep in the inn.  We have the option to sleep in the stables and have access to the bathhouses and town stuff.
- [[Iris]] - Fought with innkeeper person about where her animals will be staying
- [[D'kar]] - Woke up in a pile of hay in the inn.  Think he's been there for a few days.
- [[Iris]] recognizes [[D'kar]] and vice versa.
